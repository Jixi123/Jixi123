## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Jixiang Li, a junior at Carnegie Mellon University double majoring in Computer Science and Robotics. In addition to research, I have experience working on a wide variety of robotics projects including autonomous racecars, agricultural robots, and MoonRanger, a student-built lunar rover, and have worked with both Python and C++. 

I've had industry experience working at Amazon Robotics and Hyvee as software engineer interns, and am currently looking for Ai/Robotics related software engineering intern roles for the summer of 2025. Feel free to reach out!
